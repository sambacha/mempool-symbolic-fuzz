# eth_txpool_fuzzer_core/__init__.py

# This file makes the directory a Python package.
# We can expose key classes and functions here for easier imports by users of the library.

# For example, later we might do:
# from .tx import Tx, Input
# from .accounts import AccountManager
# from .client_comms import EthereumClient
# from .state import get_symbolic_pool_state, get_txpool_energy
# from .exploit_detectors import ExploitCondition, PendingEmptyExploit, LowTxCostExploit, EpsilonBasedExploit
# from .fuzz_engine import FuzzEngine, Seed, SeedDatabase
# from . import config

# For now, keeping it simple. Scenarios will import directly from modules.
